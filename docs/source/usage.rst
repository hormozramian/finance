This short course is intended for first-year graduate students in business schools majoring in finance or related field with various backgrounds. The primary focus is to introduce the contexts surrounding financial markets, financial institutions, and their operations. The course primarily uses an intuitive perspective to introduce notations, definitions and applications whilst also adopting a reasonable amount of rigour.

Finance discipline is primarily defined as the underlying operations to fund institutional activities. This outset primes two quintessential features that the study of finance, within both academic and professional contexts, is devoted to exploring. First, from the perspective of institutions that run activities, the study of finance provides a foundation to enhance access to funds to run operations and fulfil institutional goals such as profit maximization, improving environmental outcomes, and more broadly delivering monetary or non-monetary objectives. More specifically, the study of finance provides access to extended funds (extensive margins) and when possible, at a cheaper cost per each acquired unit (intensive margin). Second and from the perspective of financiers who supply the funds to those who run operations, the study of finance provides a foundation to generate better outcomes on their funds. Similarly, such outcomes are characterized by monetary outcomes or alternatively non-monetary outcomes, for example, enhancing environmental consideration beyond pecuniary motives. In particular, the finance discipline informs financiers to methodically incorporate the relevant information to establish valuations as a basis to compare available investment opportunities and determine decisions.
